## A motorcycle journey in Northern Italy – Between roads, lagoons and postcard hills

The tank is full, the bag is strapped to the saddle, helmet and gloves fastened.  
I look at myself in the mirror: the expression is that of a convinced rider.  
I'm ready.

As always, first fixed stop: **rest stop**.  
That's where a motorcycle journey really begins.  
Breakfast, a couple of laughs with travel companions and a glance at the route — more out of habit than necessity — and we're off.

We're on the A4, heading to Veneto. Final destination: **Po Delta**.  
But motorcycles, you know… when they see a mountain ahead, they catch fire.  
So near Vicenza we decide to **look for some curves** and climb towards the **Asiago plateau**.

The climb is gentle, the bikes are warm and the sound of the engines becomes music.  
At the top an immense panorama welcomes us: an expanse of meadows as far as the eye can see and, behind us, the plain unfolding to the horizon.  
One of those moments when a "wow" comes out without thinking.

But the mountain immediately reminds us who's in charge:  
from the sky drops begin to fall… actually, they seem like **small grains of ice**.  
Emotions rise and fall faster than the road: wonder → worry.  
Not exactly ideal conditions for a two-wheeled vehicle.

Emergency shelter at a gas station.  
We put on our rain gear, look at each other as if to say "shall we go? …let's go".  
And we set off again. Slowly, with respect for the asphalt, but with hearts that laugh.

A few kilometers and the sky opens up.  
It seems to almost make fun of us.  
The engine starts singing again and we with it.

We descend from the plateau and arrive in **Bassano del Grappa**.  
An iconic red bridge, a well-deserved aperitif and the satisfaction of a day already full.

## Lagoons, silence and pink flamingos

The next day we set off early again: highway to **Chioggia**, little Venice.  
Canals, fishing boats, bridges: a city that has the air of knowing a lot about the sea.  
First stop: **baccalà mantecato**. And here you immediately understand you're in the right place.

Then off, heading to **Po Delta**.  
And here the journey changes.  
The thin islands of land seem to float on the water, the canals get lost on the horizon and the motorcycle glides through the lagoon as if suspended.

All of a sudden — like in an impressionist painting —  
**pink flamingos** looking for food in the water.  
If I hadn't been there, I would never have believed it.

![Pink Flamingos](https://res.cloudinary.com/dx6hrvg6l/image/upload/v1764098306/delta-del-po-01_hsakib.jpg)

On the road we encounter **boat bridges**, fishermen's houses and campers parked in places that seem made to **watch the sunset and forget the clock**.

![Boat bridge](https://res.cloudinary.com/dx6hrvg6l/image/upload/v1764098306/delta-del-po-04_mm8fya.jpg)

The Delta is like this:  
calm, silent, full of real life.  
And it makes you want to drop everything and stop.

But the schedule doesn't forgive.  
With the sun diving into the lagoon, we set off again towards **Marina di Ravenna**.  
Off-season, silent, with the beach establishments asleep by the sea.  
We eat something quickly and collapse into bed, tired and happy.

## Tuscan-Emilian Apennines: woods, dirt roads and good wine

New departure, new clouds.  
Near Cesena a sudden rain forces us to take shelter again under an awning — the famous "Fantozzi cloud" caught us right in the middle.

Past the downpour, we decide to **leave the highway** and slip between the curves of the Tuscan-Emilian Apennines.  
Dense woods, roads worn by time… and the feeling of being in a place where **phones don't work but thoughts do**.

We arrive in **Arezzo** in the afternoon.  
Our B&B is on top of a hill among olive trees.  
To reach it: a dirt road that's more adventure than road, but the motorcycles — proud — don't bat an eyelid.

From the garden the view is perfect: **Tuscan hills chasing each other** under the golden sky.  
Energy recharged, we go discover the city → medieval walls, a Medici fortress and an atmosphere from a historical film.

The evening closes in glory with a **peposo** that makes us get up from the table reconciled with the world.

## Val d'Orcia: when reality exceeds imagination

New day, clear goal: **the cypresses**.  
But first we cross the **Crete Senesi**: breathtaking views, colors that seem chosen with care by a painter.

Then we enter **Val d'Orcia**.  
And there the heart goes "click".  
Perfect hills, perched villages, endless fields.  
It seems like an image you already knew… only now you're inside it.

We visit **Montalcino** and **Pienza**, both beautiful, and along the road I finally find **the perfect spot to photograph the famous cypresses**.  
Check ✔️

Then down towards the **Tuscan Maremma** to **Castiglione della Pescaia**:  
from the Adriatic to the Tyrrhenian — coast to coast is completed!  
Sunset on the sea, smell of fish and the awareness that this journey has its own rhythm, and we're following it perfectly.

## Curves, sea and Ferrari

Penultimate day.  
We follow the coast towards **Livorno**, maritime pines guarding the road and the sea that seems within reach.  
Here we treat ourselves to a **proper cacciucco**.  
For equal treatment, we exit the highway and go to **Pisa**: the Tower still leans, fortunately.

Then enough plain: it's time for curves.  
We climb towards the **Abetone Pass**:  
beautiful road, perfect rhythm… but at the top it's **freezing**.  
The ski facilities are sleeping, the town is deserted and finding something to eat becomes a small mission.  
It's part of the adventure, right?

Last day: **Maranello**.  
Here everything is red.  
The Prancing Horse is everywhere and you can't help but feel a bit part of that story.

We visit the **Ferrari Museum**, I daydream.  
In front of the historic factory entrance I wonder what it must be like to work creating **cars that make the world dream**.

![Ferrari factory entrance](https://res.cloudinary.com/dx6hrvg6l/image/upload/v1764098307/maranello-01_gq0cat.jpg)

Then we head home.  
Smooth highway to Milan, while in my head flows like a perfect playlist:

- the snow on the Asiago plateau
- the pink flamingos of the Delta
- the curves of the Apennines
- the hills of Val d'Orcia
- the roar of the engine that always does the heart good

> Riding is beautiful.
> And Italy is the best place to do it.

Every curve has been a taste of something I want to rediscover.  
And I already know I'll put wheels on these roads again.  

Because **there are journeys that end**…  
and others that **never stop calling you**.
