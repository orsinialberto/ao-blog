## Introduction

The Cammino dei Borghi Silenti is one of those routes that surprise you from the first step. Among quiet paths and villages that seem suspended in time, you breathe a simple and authentic atmosphere. The stone houses, the views that open up suddenly and the encounters along the way create a mix that warms the heart.

It reminded me a bit of the Way of St. James, but here Italian beauty adds that extra touch that makes the experience even more special. A journey that doesn't just make you walk, but slows you down.

## Day 1: Tenaglie - Melezzole

The first day of the journey starts with an alarm at dawn, one of those moments when you ask yourself why you decided to take a vacation… by walking. A quick breakfast at the village bar and then off we go, we really set off. In a few minutes the asphalt disappears behind us and I find myself immersed in lentil fields, wrapped in low clouds that brush the ground while the sun struggles to appear.

After a few kilometers I meet two walkers, Daniele and Pamela. I don't know it yet, but they will become my traveling companions for the entire route. The first stage is Guardea, a rather large village compared to the ones we'll encounter later. We stop at the grocery store to get our packed lunch and then continue walking.

Through silent woods and fields that seem to never end, we finally arrive at the first real village: the tiny, enchanting village of Santa Restituta. As soon as we arrive, a local welcomes us with some refreshment, as if he was waiting for us. We decide to eat our sandwich there and, while we enjoy the break, other walkers arrive.

That's when an elderly gentleman appears. He stops, checks his heartbeat — the staircase to reach the village is a survival test — and, since "he's still alive", begins to tell us stories of the village and the territory. One of those small encounters that make a journey richer than any postcard.

After the break, we continue walking and choose the longer variant, the one that passes through the famous Cyclamen Estate of Mogol. The idea of being able to meet him almost puts wings on our feet… but nothing, not even a shadow. Maybe though we crossed paths with some future music star without even knowing it. Who knows.

Left the estate, we head towards Toscolano. The path enters the woods and there begins an up and down that seems to never want to end. The village is at the top, we see it… yet the path continues to descend. Every now and then we look at each other as if to say: "Are we sure we're going in the right direction?". But we continue, confident and a bit resigned.

Finally the path starts to climb again and we arrive in Toscolano, another perfectly preserved village, a small gem that seems to have come out of an illustrated book. We explore it all, alley after alley, and then set off again towards the final destination of the day: Melezzole.

The last stretch passes quickly and in no time we reach the third village of the day. Melezzole is also impeccable and has a concentric structure that makes it even more particular. Inside there are only a grocery store, a bar and a church: essential, silent, authentic. Nothing else.

The day closes like this: time to all meet up for dinner, a chat and then straight to the room. After all that up and down, collapsing into bed is not a choice… it's the natural consequence.

## Day 2: Melezzole - Morre

The second day begins with a few quiet kilometers… before the climb decides to really make itself felt. The legs protest, the breath becomes short, but with a slow and steady step I manage to reach the summit. At the top, the landscape opens up and a large meadow accompanies our steps towards the highest point of the mountain. Unfortunately it's still early and, in September, the Umbrian hills in the morning like to hide behind low clouds and a light drizzle. Patience, nature has its own timing.

We re-enter the woods and, gaining a few more meters of elevation, among the birch branches we finally find the cross that marks the summit. The sky is still overcast and we miss what, they say, would be the most beautiful view of the entire journey. Never mind. After a brief rest under the cross, we set off again.

At the exit from the woods a steep descent awaits us, a good test for the already aching knees. Further on, the path takes us into a wonderful chestnut grove, among ups and downs that seem to never end. Finally we reach Morruzze, a tiny village of four houses with a spectacular view of the surrounding hills. Here we stop to eat our sandwiches, before setting off again towards Morre.

The destination is not far and, after a few kilometers, here we are in Morre. It's still early, so we allow ourselves some rest before exploring the village. Here I sleep in my first donation-based accommodation: welcoming me is a lady from the village, who makes available the room of one of her sons who are now far away. She's very kind, welcoming and happy to meet walkers. With her I immediately feel at home, a warmth that will accompany me for the entire journey and that will remain one of the most beautiful memories.

Having recovered our energy, we go out to visit Morre, the fifth village of the journey: well preserved and particular, because it doesn't follow the classic concentric plan. Then, since Collelungo is just a stone's throw away, we decide to reach it. Here too everything is small, quiet and authentic. We stop for an aperitif at the only bar in the village, before heading to the agriturismo.

When dinner time arrives, we all meet at the only agriturismo in the area. From there we witness a breathtaking sunset: the sky turns veiled pink and for a moment it seems that time stops. After the sunset we have dinner together with other walkers: the group grows and spirits become increasingly happy, with that lightness that only a journey among silent villages knows how to give.

## Day 3: Morre - Civitella del Lago

The third day of walking begins with a reassuring thought: "only 15 kilometers, and the hardest part is now behind us". In reality, I'm learning that walking in the heart of Italy means facing the Apennines in eternal ups and downs, without ever a moment of respite.

We leave Morre choosing the shortest road, avoiding Collelungo which we had already visited the day before. Shortly after, while crossing a dirt road, we are "attacked" by a cat that suddenly appeared from the grass. It jumps out, rubs against us, follows us for a few meters… and so, without meaning to, we make a new friend along the path.

In no time we arrive in Acqualoreto, a small but delightful village like all the others. Under an entrance arch we find a small library that seems to have come out of an illustrated book. We cross the village and re-enter the woods: here the raised hunting posts and a meadow of pink flowers that stand out among the beeches capture our attention, a small spectacle of nature.

The journey continues until we find ourselves in front of a steep climb, short but more intense than that of Monte Croce di Serra. The fatigue makes itself felt, perhaps more than the previous day. When we finally emerge in front of a small church set under a rock – the Sanctuary of Madonna della Pasquarella – we are left speechless. Lost in nature yet perfectly preserved, I wonder how they managed to build it up there.

We continue walking and reach Civitella del Lago, perched high with a view of Lake Corbara that is simply spectacular. We stop at the bar to refresh ourselves and enjoy the panorama: today's stage is also completed.

In the evening we have dinner at an inn in the village, always with a view of the lake, while the sky gives us one of the most beautiful sunsets I've ever seen. After dinner, we return to the hostel: the day is over and we can finally rest.

## Day 4: Civitella del Lago - Baschi

The fourth day starts quietly: we're almost at the end now and today's stage is short. The goal is not to rush, but to reach the famous winery that offers a tasting to walkers.

We leave Civitella del Lago and the path enters among olive trees before emerging on a provincial road. Chatting, we get distracted and walk without paying attention to the route signs. After a while we realize that something doesn't add up: no trace, no signal. We check the map and discover we've taken the wrong road. We laugh at the distraction, take it philosophically and go back. At the crossroads we finally take the right direction and arrive in Cerreto.

We cross the village and, shortly after, reach the long-awaited winery. The owners welcome us warmly and let us taste different wines from their production. They're all excellent, and I even discover that some are made with… moldy grapes! We make our purchases and continue walking.

Today too there's no lack of a good climb, made even more challenging by the sun. Once at the top we reach Baschi, the largest village of the entire journey. After days of silence and deserted streets, finding ourselves in traffic is almost a shock: we hadn't missed the cars, but the ancient part of the village is splendid. We discover that the streets are called "buchi" (holes) because they're narrow and labyrinthine, and certain walls and balconies seem to defy gravity.

Before arriving at the accommodation, we stop at the grocery store to get a sandwich with porchetta to bring the next day. Then we reach the B&B we had booked: welcoming us is a really nice and caring couple, who make us feel at home, a bit like attentive parents to every detail.

In the evening we're lucky: we manage to all have dinner together, with the group of walkers we met in the previous days. It's the last dinner together and, when the goodbyes arrive, a bit of sadness makes itself felt. But the evening doesn't end here: in the village park there's a festival and a band called "Sciroccati" is playing. The night comes alive, we sing and dance until our legs hold, thus closing the day with a smile and lots of cheer.

## Day 5: Baschi - Tenaglie

The last day is all about walking back. The couple who hosted us welcomes us with a breakfast worthy of a pastry shop: brioches, cakes, pastries… and woe to leave even a single piece! A simple and genuine gesture, which I will remember for a long time. After saying goodbye to them, we continue walking.

It's the last day and many thoughts flow through my head. The landscape is beautiful, the air fresh, and walking I feel relaxed, thinking back to everything I've experienced in these days. I'm struck by the simplicity of the people and life in these lands: everything is genuine, authentic. I feel "lighter" and understand that the journey has already left its mark.

Before reaching the last village, we pass through an Etruscan necropolis, a small dive into the most ancient history of these areas. In the center there's a rest area, but the person who should have welcomed us isn't there, so we can't enjoy their famous hospitality. Never mind: the place is fascinating and we allow ourselves a brief break anyway, between silence and suggestion.

![Etruscan Necropolis](https://res.cloudinary.com/dx6hrvg6l/image/upload/v1763734562/photo-13_aoiaxh.jpg)

Exited from the necropolis we arrive in Montecchio, the last village before returning to Tenaglie. Here too the charm is great. We stop at a small shop where an elderly lady weaves wicker baskets and creates accessories for walkers. She tells us about her story and that of the village: here traditions are not just memory, but a living part of the territory.

Left Montecchio, we finally return to Tenaglie. The journey is completed. We reach the starting point and collect the credential. We celebrate with the most delicious porchetta sandwich I've ever eaten and wait for the arrival of the other walkers. One by one everyone arrives: we congratulate each other, share impressions and comments on the route, happy to have lived together this adventure among silent villages.

The journey has come to an end and, as always happens, it leaves something inside. In these days I discovered a different Italy: more traditional, authentic, made of people who live simply and who welcome you as if you were family. Listening to the stories of an elderly local, being hosted by strangers with a kindness that asks for nothing in return… these are moments that remain.

The solidarity of people is a gift that we often forget, caught up in the frenzy of daily life, and which instead deserves to be recognized and cherished. Walking frees you from stress, slows you down, brings you back in contact with what really matters.

Framing all this is a landscape that seems designed specifically for a slow journey: hills of olives and vines, chestnut woods, perfectly preserved villages. A scenario that accompanies, supports and amplifies every emotion. A simple journey, but capable of leaving a deep mark.
