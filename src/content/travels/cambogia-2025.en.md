## Introduction

Cambodia is one of those countries that surprises you as soon as you step out of the airport. Before leaving, I knew little about its history, but once there I discovered a rich, intense world, at times bright and at times painful. Here flourished the greatest civilization of Southeast Asia, the Angkor civilization; it was a French colony, leaving behind corners of unusual European charm; and unfortunately it experienced one of the most terrible tragedies of the twentieth century with the Khmer Rouge regime.

## Phnom Penh

Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, is a city made of such strong contrasts that it leaves you disoriented from the first moment. My first impact was almost traumatic: I took my first tuk tuk in my life and even today I don't know how we managed to arrive safe and sound at the hostel. The traffic is pure chaos, a total entropy in which no rule seems to exist... yet everything flows, everything works. The streets are invaded by tuk tuks and remork motos, two per lane, with scooters squeezing into every possible space. In the middle of this river of vehicles appear luxury cars with tinted windows, as if they belonged to another world. It's controlled chaos, inexplicably effective. Incredible to say, but I didn't see a single accident.

Walking around the city, you immediately notice an evident split: the tourist area, well-kept and orderly, and the rest of the city, where life flows in a more raw way. Here many very poor people work in small improvised shops along the streets, selling everything. But it's especially the markets that struck me: they represent the real Asia, the one I imagined before leaving. People sitting on the ground selling any kind of food, stalls covered with sheets that serve as roof and walls, alleys so narrow they make you lose your bearings. For Cambodians it's normal; for me it was a fascinating cultural shock, something completely different from my habits.

I visited the main attractions of the city: the National Museum, the Royal Palace and the Silver Pagoda. All beautiful and interesting places, but nothing struck me as much as what is found just outside Phnom Penh. I visited a Killing Field and came out shaken. The feeling was the same I had experienced visiting a Nazi concentration camp: a heavy air, a silence that crushes you, a sadness difficult to describe. While listening to the history of the Khmer Rouge regime I kept asking myself questions. The horror that human beings are capable of inflicting on other human beings is something we struggle to understand. How many broken lives for an ideology.

Despite everything, I had the feeling that Cambodians are living a new, more serene phase. It's a people that carries the scars of its history but seems to look forward with admirable strength.

Phnom Penh, however, is not just history and chaos: it's also the place where I ate the best food in all of Cambodia. I tried fried frogs, Lok Lak - a spiced beef dish served with rice - and fish Amok, a real delight that even today, just thinking about it, makes my mouth water.

At a distance, I still don't know for sure if I liked Phnom Penh or not. It's a city that divides, that confuses you, that provokes you. A city of contrasts, as I wrote at the beginning. Perhaps that's exactly why it stayed with me: because it doesn't leave you indifferent.

## Battambang

Battambang is a city that preserves a fascinating French colonial style, an elegant contrast to the rural life that surrounds it. Thanks to a tour organized by the hostel, I had the opportunity to immerse myself in the daily life of the most authentic Cambodia. I saw a family producing rice paper directly at home, another distilling rice wine, a very strong liquor that Cambodians often drink after meals. Along the road I met a lady cooking grilled rats: the guide explained to us that, during the Khmer Rouge period, the population was forced to eat everything they found, from rats to insects.

Among the various stalls I tasted bamboo sticky rice, a typical sweet made of rice cooked inside a bamboo cane: simple, sweet, particular.

Left the rural area, I also had my first taste of Angkorian culture visiting Wat Ek Phnom, a temple from the Angkor era, just a preview of what I would see later in Siem Reap.

In Battambang I also tried the famous bamboo train experience: a kind of platform mounted on real rails that speeds through the Cambodian fields. A fun attraction... until they stopped us announcing that the real train was coming. Only at that moment did I realize that it wasn't an abandoned line: pure Cambodian madness.

I then visited Phnom Sampeau, where the Killing Cave and the Bat Cave are located. The Killing Cave is a terrible place of memory: a hill where the Khmer Rouge tortured and killed Cambodians. The temples built on top, immersed in the forest, and the monkeys that populate the area coexisting with the inhabitants... scaring all the tourists, are striking.

Under the hill is the Bat Cave: at sunset I witnessed an impressive spectacle. Millions of bats - an estimated 6.5 million - come out of the cave and fly towards Lake Tonlé Sap in search of food. For more than an hour I watched this animated black river flow in the sky: an image I won't easily forget.

And it's right here, in this part of Cambodia, that I saw the most beautiful panoramas of the journey: the view from above of Phnom Sampeau, the rice fields crossed by the railway and the entrance to the gigantic Lake Tonlé Sap, where a herd of buffaloes grazed on grass immersed in water. Scenes so intense that they remain imprinted even without needing a photo.

A special mention goes to the journey from Battambang to Siem Reap. I traveled the route on a small boat that goes up the river to Tonlé Sap. During navigation I was able to admire the famous floating villages, villages built on stilts where life takes place entirely on water: children who drive the boat alone to go to school, families who fish, cook and live suspended between sky and river.

I was also struck by the enormous expanse of Asian lotus flowers that covered the watercourse: at one point the boat even got stuck in the middle of that green carpet, managing to free itself only thanks to the skill of the Cambodian boatman.

## Siem Reap

Arriving in Siem Reap was like changing atmosphere with a click. After the crazy traffic of Phnom Penh and the rural charm of Battambang, Siem Reap seemed almost like another Cambodia: orderly, modern, with a surprisingly European touch. You can feel that we're one step away from one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, and the city seems to want to welcome in the best way those who come to discover Angkor.

The first thing I did - needless to say - was go to the night market along the river. You know: if there's a market, I end up inside. Warm lights, stalls, street food scents... a small well-organized chaos, as I like.

Out of the market, almost by mistake, I found myself in Pub Street. And there I thought: "But where did I end up?". The entrance is marked by a huge red neon sign, and from there it's a dive into a completely different world: bars and pubs everywhere, restaurants lit by garish lights, deafening music bouncing from one venue to another.
I saw sports bars in full American style, with maxi-screens broadcasting any existing sport, tourists intent on devouring hamburgers and drinking beer as if there were no tomorrow. The "Italian" restaurant couldn't be missing (quotes mandatory), with creative pizzas and pasta of dubious past in the homeland. Next to it, an old-school Irish pub... and immediately after a modern Chinese-style disco.

In short: lights, neon, chaos, party. A corner of Cambodia that I didn't expect to find at all, but which - in being so out of context - has a charm all its own.

## Angkor Wat

These are the temples I visited in the Angkor area: Pre Rup, East Mebon, Ta Som, Neak Pean, Preah Khan, Angkor Wat, Bayon, Angkor Thom, Phimeanakas, Ta Keo, Ta Prohm, Banteay Kdei, Banteay Srei, Preah Ko, Bakong and Lolei.
Listing them is easy; really describing them would require an entire encyclopedia. Each one has its own character, a detail that surprises you, a corner that leaves you speechless.

Walking among these ruins is a journey through time: you find yourself catapulted into an era when rulers were considered deities, and every stone tells the greatness of an empire that ruled this land for centuries.
At Angkor Wat I felt like an archaeologist, intent on reading the bas-reliefs that flow like pages of an ancient story. At Ta Prohm, on the other hand, it's impossible not to transform into explorers: here nature has won, has crushed the walls and embraced the towers with gigantic roots.
Bayon, however, is the temple that gave me the most chills. Walking among hundreds of faces carved in stone, watching you from every direction, is an almost hypnotic experience. You feel small, watched, part of something ancient and imposing.

Visiting the temples of Angkor was an experience that, alone, is worth a trip to Cambodia.

One of the most beautiful things was seeing the sunrise at Angkor Wat and the sunset from the top of Phnom Bakheng.
The sunrise was magical: the sky lit up orange and the sun appeared behind one of the wonders of the modern world. I took photos that looked like postcards, but reality was even more beautiful.

The sunset, on the other hand, gave me a different emotion. It had rained all day, and for this reason I didn't see the sun go down behind the forest. But the rain had left an almost sacred silence: we were few, the light wind, the view over a sea of trees where Angkor Wat stood imposingly.
It was a moment of total peace, one of those where you feel the energy coming back to you all at once.

Three days at Angkor weren't enough - and in fact it's really true that appetite comes with eating.
So on the fourth day I decided to push further and visit the Koh Ker area and the Preah Vihear temple, almost on the border with Thailand.

At Koh Ker I found one of the tallest temples I've ever seen, a pyramid that rises towards the sky and gives you an incredible panorama: an infinite expanse of Cambodian forest, green and powerful.

Preah Vihear, on the other hand, dominates a plateau with a view that spans between Cambodia and Thailand. To go up you have to change means: the road is too steep and winding, so only authorized guides can accompany you with their pick-ups.
At the top, the temple is spectacular, and the monkeys that roam among the ruins make the scene even more surreal.

There's a detail I didn't expect: along the road I noticed military posts, soldiers and even some tanks camouflaged in the vegetation. Once we arrived, other army posts were visible among the ruins.
Talking with our companions I discovered that here the tension between Cambodia and Thailand is still high: the area is disputed, and a few days before there had been a firefight in which a Cambodian had died.

Fortunately I didn't experience any dangerous moments, but it's disturbing to think that, right in those days, the situation was getting worse again.
Yet, despite everything, the beauty of Preah Vihear remains something difficult to forget.

## Kampot - Kep

The last stop of my journey was Kampot. To reach it I crossed practically all of Cambodia: almost ten hours on a shared minibus with the local population. Cambodians often use these means to move around and they really load everything. On mine, in addition to passengers, huge sacks of rice and even a scooter were traveling. A decidedly authentic experience.

Kampot is a quiet town overlooking a slow river, with an air that seems to change depending on the season. In summer it comes alive with water sports and nightlife; in June, when I was there, the city was quieter, almost sleepy. The hostel I stayed in was immersed in greenery, on the banks of the river: a beautiful place, almost suspended in time. Too bad that the low tourist influx and daily rain made it a bit too quiet.

Kampot is famous for pepper, considered one of the best in the world. I visited a small farm where workers hand-selected, one by one, the grains destined for export. A meticulous job that reveals how precious this product is for the region. For the rest, Kampot seemed to me a serene city, dotted with bars and restaurants along the river, much more residential than the other locations seen in Cambodia.

A short distance away is Kep, famous for its crab market. Here I saw impressive quantities of fresh fish and mountains of freshly caught crabs, ready to be cooked. The atmosphere is the chaotic and vibrant one of Southeast Asian markets: intense scents, vendors' cries, steaming pots. After seeing it I certainly couldn't leave without tasting the famous Kampot pepper crab. After Amok, it's certainly one of the best things I've eaten on the entire journey.

I've always dreamed of traveling to Asia and when I chose Cambodia I did it with a precise desire: to find that authenticity that more touristy countries often lose. I wanted to live a backpacking adventure, sleep in hostels, eat local food, move around like Cambodians do. And in the end I can say I found exactly what I was looking for - and perhaps even more.

Cambodia showed me a world very far from mine, made of strong, extreme contrasts. I saw deep poverty and unexpected riches, a generation still marked by the wounds of the Khmer Rouge regime and at the same time a people proud of their roots, children of the extraordinary Angkorian civilization. A country that carries both the scars and the greatness of its history.

This journey made me reflect a lot: we all live in the same world, yet our lives flow on completely different tracks. Cambodia left me with this thought, together with the feeling of having grown a bit as a traveler and as a person.

An authentic, hard and beautiful journey. One of those that stay with you.
