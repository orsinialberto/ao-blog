## Rota Vicentina – The Fishermen's Trail

Before leaving I had researched lengths and elevation gains and my thought had been:  
*"Easy, come on. A relaxing ocean-view stroll."*  
I've never been more wrong.

The Rota Vicentina, the **Fishermen's Trail**, runs along the western coast of Portugal, from Porto Covo to Cabo de São Vicente, then continuing towards the more touristic Lagos.

My journey begins in **Porto Covo**, a small fishing village overlooking the ocean. The sunset of the first day is a perfect taste of what awaits me: the sun sinking into the sea and a fiery sky that seems to want to inaugurate the adventure.

## Sand, cliffs and sinking feet

The next morning we leave early. The path stays high on a jagged cliff, with the ocean always to my left. Sand everywhere. Red sand, golden sand, sand that swallows your feet with every step.  
I immediately understand that here it's not the elevation gains that are the problem: it's the terrain.  
I walk, stop, empty my shoes. Repeat. All day.

But just raise your gaze and the fatigue vanishes:  
the blue of the ocean, the bright green of the succulents that explode between the sand, the salty wind that arrives strong from the sea… a continuous spectacle.

Every now and then, among the waves, **fishermen swimming with a basket on their shoulders** appear. They reach isolated rocks to catch the fish that — guess what — I find on my plate every evening.  
A simple and courageous life, made of sea and salt.

**Surfers** who dive into the water armed with boards in search of the perfect wave and **campers** parked on top of the cliffs, with a privileged view of the sunset, are not lacking.  
It's impossible not to fantasize: you want to drop everything, buy a van and move here, where life seems lighter and everything smells of freedom.

## Walk, swim, sunset: the perfect routine

One of the most beautiful things about this journey is the end of the day:  
after kilometers in the sand and some muttered curses through clenched teeth, you arrive at the village and… **go to the beach**.

Barefoot, finally.  
A dive into the icy water of the ocean and your feet feel new again.  
The feeling of peace is indescribable.

Then the **sunset** arrives. And what sunsets.  
The kind that imprint themselves on you and remind you why you walk: the sound of the waves, the wind in your face, the sky lighting up and you breathing slower.

## The magic that fades… and what remains

Up to **Cabo de São Vicente** it's pure poetry: wild nature, very few people, slow rhythms.  
But then the coast changes: crowded beaches appear, colorful umbrellas, traffic, music.  
You enter the most touristic area of the Algarve and a bit of that magic gets lost along the way.

The journey concludes in **Lagos**, a young and festive city.  
The arrival doesn't have a symbolic place — perhaps a statue, perhaps a station — but in the end it doesn't matter.

Because what really remains are:
 - the cliffs that challenge the sea
 - the tired and happy feet
 - that silent thought that tells you: *"I wish it would never end"*

A journey that tests you at every step…  
but that rewards you with **sunsets that recompose your heart**, views that leave you breathless and a sense of freedom that you rarely find elsewhere.

The Rota Vicentina is like this:  
**wild, hard, wonderful.**

## A closing from the trail

During this journey I read a book that kept me company every evening:  
*A Walk in the Woods* by Bill Bryson.  
There's a passage that, more than all others, describes exactly what I experienced on the Rota Vicentina:

> *"Life takes on a drastic simplicity when walking.  
> Time loses its usual meaning.  
> When it's dark you go to sleep, when it's day you get up,  
> and everything in between is simply in between.  
> It's really a wonderful thing."*  
> — Bill Bryson, *A Walk in the Woods*

There you go: this is the journey.  
And that's why I keep setting off.
